# USULAN PERUBAHAN PROSEDUR ONLINE (UPP Online)

### Description
Usulan Perubahan Prosedur Online (UPP Online) is a website application developed using PHP and MySQL as the database. UPP Online developed to manage proposal that changes company procedures. The previous process still used paper or word documents so that the data was not well integrated and high time-consuming as it requires multiple approvals from different people. From these problems, the SMOL application was made to solve the problems.
